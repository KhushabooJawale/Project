Pfizer aims to leverage clinical trial and genomics data to address critical challenges in personalized medicine. The primary goal is to identify the demographic and genetic factors influencing drug efficacy and variability in patient response. A deeper understanding of these factors will enable the development of more targeted treatments, ensuring better health outcomes while minimizing adverse side effects. Additionally, the analysis seeks to uncover patterns in side effects and determine the most effective treatment plans based on progression-free survival rates, providing actionable insights to optimize future clinical trial designs and treatment strategies.
